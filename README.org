* plotseries -- Time-Series Plots

  Plot financial time-series, such as a portfolio value or
  stock price.  The package provides a single function,
  plotseries(), that creates high-quality, informative, but
  uncluttered graphics.  Multiple series can be aggregated
  into fanplots, the code for which is based on chapter 15
  of "[[http://enricoschumann.net/NMOF.htm][Numerical Methods and Optimization in Finance]]", second
  edition, by M. Gilli, D. Maringer and E. Schumann (2019,
  ISBN:978-0128150658).  Also supported is plotting streaks,
  i.e. periods of uninterrupted up or down movement.

v0.2-0  (2022-12-12; not yet released))

  o plotseries now supports different types of plots,
    controlled by argument 'series.type': "level" (the
    default), "fan", "quantile", "streaks".
    For examples, see the vignette, or this note:
    http://enricoschumann.net/notes/streaks-in-equity-returns-and-yield-changes.html

  o the 'par' settings that plotseries changes
    internally are restored to previous values when the
    function ends

  o support for "zoo::yearmon" timestamps, as well as
    plain numeric timestamps (1, 2, 3, ...)

  o provide options to automatically place (and
    displace) labels to avoid overlap

  o see the ChangeLog for more details

v0.1-0  (2019-09-19)

  o initial release: the package provides a single
    function, 'plotseries', that plots one or several
    (financial) time-series

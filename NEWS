v0.4-0  (2024-10-24; not yet released)

  o support POSIXt timestamps

  o new arguments "shade.start", "shade.end" and
    "shade.col" for background shading

  o new argument "time.labels.cex"

  o argument "warn.fan1" has been renamed to "warn1", since
    it also affects quantile plots

  o ....

v0.3-0  (2024-05-25)

  o plotseries now invisibly returns a list with parameters

  o quantile and fan plots now render (much) faster

  o new argument "reset.par"; if TRUE (the default), par
    settings are restored after plotting. (But FALSE is
    often appropriate if additional elements are to be
    added, e.g. via 'abline'.)

  o line type can now be specified with 'lty', as in
    standard 'plot'

  o new argument "warn.fan1"; if TRUE, warn when a fanplot
    is to be computed from a single series (the warning had
    always been issued, and the new argument provides a way
    to suppress it)

  o 'quantile' and 'fan' plots add labels to all chosen
    "probs", not just the median

  o fixed: argument 'median.col' had been ignored in 'fan'
    plots

v0.2-0  (2023-09-28)

  o plotseries now supports different types of plots,
    controlled by argument 'series.type': "level" (the
    default), "fan", "quantile", "streaks".  For examples,
    see the vignette, or this note:
    http://enricoschumann.net/notes/streaks-in-equity-returns-and-yield-changes.html

  o the 'par' settings that plotseries changes internally
    are restored to previous values when the function ends

  o experimental support for "zoo::yearmon" timestamps,
    as well as plain numeric timestamps (1, 2, 3, ...)

  o experimental options to automatically displace (shift)
    labels to avoid overlap

  o see the ChangeLog for more details

v0.1-0  (2019-09-19)

  o initial release: the package provides a single
    function, 'plotseries', that plots one or several
    (financial) time-series

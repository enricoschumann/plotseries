Description: Plot financial time-series, such as a portfolio
  value or stock price.  The package provides a single
  function, plotseries(), that creates high-quality,
  informative, but uncluttered graphics.  Multiple series
  can be aggregated into quantile and fan plots, the code
  for which is based on chapter 15 of "Numerical Methods and
  Optimization in Finance", second edition, by M. Gilli,
  D. Maringer and E. Schumann (2019, ISBN:978-0128150658).
  Also supported is plotting streaks, i.e. periods of
  uninterrupted up or down movement.

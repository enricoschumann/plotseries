Description: Plot the time-series of a portfolio value or
  stock price.  The aim is to provide high-quality,
  informative, but uncluttered graphics.  Multiple series
  can be aggregated into fanplots, the code for which is
  based on chapter 15 of "Numerical Methods and
  Optimization in Finance", second edition, by M. Gilli,
  D. Maringer and E. Schumann (2019, ISBN:978-0128150658).
  Also supported is plotting streaks, i.e. periods of
  uninterrupted up or down movement.
